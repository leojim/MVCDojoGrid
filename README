MVCDojoGrid is an html helper extension for MVC3 projects.
It allows to add the EnhancedGrid with as little code as possible and at the same time being very extensible.

The dojo library used in this project is 1.6.1
This project is still in very intial stage and a lot of things could change.

I will be updating this readme file as I commit new changes.
